# Feature Catalog

This page summarizes CartoBoost feature surfaces and the modeling reasons to use
them. Detailed API contracts live in the linked topic pages and in the Python
API reference.

For taxi-trip science, choose features by the effect you need to measure:

- dense numeric features for scalar facts such as distance, fare components,
  coordinates, and recent counts;
- periodic features for cyclic time such as hour of day or day of week;
- sparse sets for rows that belong to several zones, cells, hierarchies, or
  route memberships;
- graph features when relationships among zones, routes, and time buckets are
  the signal;
- neural embeddings when stable high-cardinality IDs carry repeated residual
  behavior;
- SHAP explanations when you need an additive audit of how fitted features
  contributed to predictions.

## Regression Estimator

`cartoboost.CartoBoostRegressor` is the main sklearn-style estimator for
tabular, temporal, spatial, and sparse-set regression.

| Feature | Public surface | Modeling use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L2 regression | `loss="l2"` or `"squared_error"` | Mean-oriented fare, duration, or demand targets. |
| L1 regression | `loss="l1"`, `"mae"`, or `"absolute_error"` | Robust median-like fits with constant leaves. |
| Huber regression | `loss="huber"`, `huber_delta=...` | Robust squared-error compromise with constant leaves. |
| Log-L2 regression | `loss="log_l2"`, `log_offset=1.0` | Positive skewed taxi targets such as fare or duration. |
| Quantile regression | `loss="quantile"` or `"pinball"`, `quantile_alpha=...` | Conditional quantiles for delay or fare-risk analysis. |
| Constant leaves | `leaf_predictor="constant"` | Default tree leaf behavior. |
| Linear leaves | `leaf_predictor="linear"`, `linear_leaf_features=[...]` | Local linear residual trends inside tree regions. |
| Sample weights | `fit(..., sample_weight=...)` | Weighted studies, rebalancing, or survey-style emphasis. |
| Monotonic constraints | `monotonic_constraints=[-1, 0, 1, ...]` | Enforce known directional effects in supported fits. |
| Additive values | `predict_additive_values(...)` | Per-tree additive contributions whose row sum matches prediction. |
| sklearn compatibility | `get_params`, `set_params`, `clone`, `Pipeline`, `GridSearchCV` | Standard estimator workflows. |
| Artifacts | `save`, `load`, `save_weights`, `load_weights` | Versioned model and weights artifacts. |
| ONNX export subset | `save_weights(path, format="onnx")` | Requires `cartoboost[onnx]`; dense axis-tree subset only. |

## Splitters And Feature Semantics

Splitters tell the model what geometry or data shape is meaningful.

| Splitter | Public names | Modeling use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automatic | `auto` or `splitters=None` | Conservative default search. |
| Axis | `axis` | Standard one-feature thresholds. |
| Histogram axis | `axis_histogram`, `axis_hist`, `histogram`, `axis_histogram:<bins>` | Faster dense numeric threshold search. |
| Diagonal 2D | `diagonal_2d`, `diagonal2d` | Oblique route or coordinate boundaries. |
| Gaussian/radial 2D | `gaussian_2d`, `gaussian2d`, `radial` | Local hotspots, airports, depots, corridors, or neighborhood effects. |
| Periodic | `periodic_time`, `periodic_24`, `periodic:<period>` | Wraparound hour, weekday, or seasonal phase. |
| Sparse set | `sparse_set`, `sparse` | List-valued zone, route, grid, H3, or S2 memberships. |
| Fuzzy routing | `fuzzy=True`, `fuzzy_bandwidth=...`, `fuzzy_kernel=...` | Fractional routing near split boundaries. |

`FeatureSchema` records dense numeric, periodic, sparse-set, H3 sparse-set, and
S2 sparse-set roles so saved artifacts and prediction inputs can be validated.

See [Feature Schema](feature_schema.md), [Sparse Features](sparse_features.md),
and [Spatial Modeling](spatial_modeling.md).

## Data Inputs And Optional Extras

Optional integrations stay optional. Helpers that require an optional package
raise a clear install error when the extra is missing.

| Capability | Public surface | Extra |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NumPy-style dense arrays | `fit(X, y)`, `predict(X)` | Core package. |
| pandas/dataframe-style inputs | Dataframe columns in estimator and forecasting helpers | Core package. |
| DuckDB relation inputs | Dense relation/query-result support | `cartoboost[duckdb]`. |
| Polars inputs | Dataframe support where documented | `cartoboost[polars]`. |
| H3 encoding | `latlng_to_h3_id`, `encode_h3_cells`, `build_h3_sparse_sets`, `h3_parent_id`, `normalize_h3_id` | `cartoboost[h3]`; validation, ID normalization, scaffold expansion, and row assembly are Rust-backed. |
| S2 encoding | `latlng_to_s2_id`, `encode_s2_cells`, `build_s2_sparse_sets`, `s2_parent_id`, `normalize_s2_id` | `cartoboost[s2]`; validation, ID normalization, and row assembly are Rust-backed. |
| Geographic sparse helpers | `build_geo_sparse_sets`, `build_zip_sparse_sets`, `coerce_geo_to_feature_id`, `coerce_zip_to_feature_id` | Core package. |
| SHAP explanations | `make_shap_explainer`, `explain_shap` | `cartoboost[explain]`. |
| Optuna workflows | Tuning examples/workflows | `cartoboost[optuna]`. |

See [Installation](installation.md), [Sparse Features](sparse_features.md), and
[SHAP Support](shap.md).

## Neural Embedding Models And Features

Neural embeddings are for stable, high-cardinality IDs that carry residual
signal, such as pickup zones, dropoff zones, OD pairs, or zone-hour buckets.
They are not the same claim as cold-zone generalization; report the split.

| Feature | Public surface | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standalone supervised ID model | `NeuralEmbeddingStandaloneRegressor` | Direct regressor over learned ID embeddings plus optional dense features. |
| Hybrid neural features | `NeuralEmbeddingRegressor` | Learns ID vectors and appends them to a tabular model. |
| Neural feature blocks | `NeuralEmbeddingFeatures` | Deterministic feature-generation helper. |
| Fallback behavior | `ArtifactFallback` and fallback arguments | Handles unseen or rare IDs through configured fallback vectors/chains. |
| Benchmark helper | `benchmark_neural_vs_cartoboost` | Quick held-out comparison between structured and neural-enhanced models. |
| Artifacts | `save`, `load` on standalone models | Persist learned embedding model state. |

See [Neural Embedding Models And Features](neural-features.md).

## Graph Models And Features

Graph support is available both as direct standalone modeling and as optional
feature generation for another estimator. Use it when zone, route, or temporal
relationships are part of the model, especially directed pickup-dropoff effects.

## General Utilities, Evaluation, And Forecasting

General utilities include Rust-backed single-series forecasts, Kalman filters,
intermittent-demand methods, sequence reference utilities, and ordinary
kriging. Kalman support includes frame-based local-level, local-linear, and
self-tuning forecasters plus diagnostic filter utilities. Sequence utilities
cover known-prefix continuation, reference-axis path inference, group-level OOF
candidate row generation, OOF leakage checks, per-group error summaries, and
aligned candidate blending. Evaluation helpers include
out-of-time, temporal blocked, spatial blocked, and grouped blocked splits;
pinball loss; interval diagnostics; residual Moran's I; jitter volatility; and
conformal residual helpers.

Forecasting is Rust-native. Python classes validate data and delegate model
training, prediction, rolling-origin backtesting, metrics, and artifact behavior
to `cartoboost._native`.

See [General Utilities](general_utilities.md), [Forecasting](forecasting.md),
and the [forecasting model guides](user-guide/forecasting-models/index.md).

## Command Line Interfaces

| Command group | Public surface | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Regression CLI | `cartoboost train`, `predict`, `eval`, `inspect` | Dense numeric CSV workflows. |
| Forecasting CLI | `cartoboost forecast fit`, `predict`, `backtest`, `compare` | Forecasting command scaffold and strict CSV validation. |

Use Python for sparse-set, graph-derived, neural embedding, and custom
forecasting workflows that need richer in-memory objects.

See [CLI Reference](reference/cli.md), [CLI User Guide](user-guide/cli.md), and
[Forecasting](forecasting.md).

## Quality And Benchmark Reporting

Benchmark claims should name the dataset, target, split, feature set, metric,
model settings, and whether data is synthetic, generated acceptance data, or
real benchmark data. For graph and neural features, keep standalone-model claims
separate from feature-generation claims.
