CartoBoost is a Rust-backed Python modeling toolkit for regression problems
where place and time are part of the signal, not just columns in a table. It is
designed for temporal-spatial work such as NYC taxi trip duration, fare amount,
pickup-zone demand, dropoff-zone demand, and pickup-to-dropoff lane forecasting.

Use CartoBoost when your scientific question depends on structure that ordinary
tabular models only see after extensive manual feature engineering:

- time has cycles, such as hour-of-day or day-of-week demand;
- location has neighborhoods, corridors, hotspots, and boundaries;
- rows can belong to multiple places, such as pickup zones, dropoff zones, or
  route cells;
- direction matters, such as `PULocationID -> DOLocationID`;
- validation must respect time, space, groups, and leakage risks;
- claims need comparison against serious baselines such as LightGBM, XGBoost,
  local forecasting models, or external forecasting libraries.

CartoBoost is not a replacement for careful study design. It gives scientists a
set of model primitives, validation tools, artifacts, and benchmark workflows
that make temporal-spatial comparisons easier to run and easier to explain.

## Scientific Fit

CartoBoost is a good fit for taxi-domain studies such as:

- estimating fare or trip duration from pickup/dropoff zones, trip distance,
  pickup hour, weekday, and route context;
- modeling pickup-zone or dropoff-zone demand over time;
- forecasting daily demand for pickup/dropoff lanes such as JFK airport trips;
- measuring whether zone membership, route geometry, periodic hour behavior, or
  graph directionality adds signal beyond dense numeric features;
- producing reproducible model artifacts and benchmark reports from fixed train
  and validation splits.

It is less useful when the data have no meaningful place/time structure, when a
simple linear model already answers the scientific question, or when the study
cannot define a leakage-aware validation design.

## Modeling Ideas

Standard boosters are strong baselines for tabular regression. CartoBoost keeps
that workflow but adds splitters and feature contracts that match common
temporal-spatial structure:

- `periodic:24` keeps hour `23` and hour `0` adjacent instead of treating
  midnight as a hard break.
- `diagonal_2d` can represent oblique spatial boundaries that axis-only trees
  approximate indirectly.
- `gaussian_2d` can isolate local hotspots, depots, airports, or service areas.
- `sparse_set` can use list-valued taxi-zone or route-cell memberships without a
  wide one-hot matrix.
- fuzzy routing can reduce hard jumps around nearby places or times.
- graph encoders and graph regressors can preserve pickup/dropoff roles and
  source-target asymmetry.

These choices should be tested against simpler alternatives. In a taxi study,
that usually means holding the latest trips or demand windows out of training,
comparing the same split against LightGBM or XGBoost for regression, and using
rolling-origin backtests for forecasting.

## First Model

Code is intentionally secondary to the modeling decision: choose a target,
choose leakage-aware splits, define place/time features, then compare against a
baseline.

```python
from cartoboost import CartoBoostRegressor

model = CartoBoostRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,
    learning_rate=0.04,
    max_depth=5,
    min_samples_leaf=30,
    splitters=["axis", "periodic:24", "diagonal_2d", "gaussian_2d"],
)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_validation)
```

For NYC taxi data, `X_train` might contain trip distance, pickup-hour,
day-of-week, pickup coordinates, dropoff coordinates, `PULocationID`,
`DOLocationID`, airport-lane flags, or route-derived features. The target might
be transformed trip duration, fare amount, or future pickup-zone demand.
