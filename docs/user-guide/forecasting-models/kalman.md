# Kalman

`KalmanForecaster` is a Rust local-linear-trend state-space forecaster. It is
useful when the series has a noisy level and a slowly changing trend.

## When To Use

Use Kalman forecasting for taxi demand or fare aggregates when recent
observations should update the level and trend without requiring a fixed
seasonal cycle. It is often a good baseline for short horizons and noisy
single-zone series.

## Scientific Role

Kalman forecasting is a state-space choice. It represents observed taxi counts
as noisy measurements of an unobserved level and trend. The model is useful
when the research question is: "What latent demand state best explains these
noisy observations, and how should that state move into the next few horizons?"

Choose Kalman when measurement noise and gradual state movement are central to
the problem. It is more scientifically appropriate than naive when the last
point may be noisy, and more direct than ARIMA when you want explicit latent
level and trend diagnostics.

## Assumptions And Failure Modes

The native forecasting class is a local-linear-trend model. It assumes the
latent level and trend evolve smoothly according to the configured process
variances, while observations deviate according to the observation variance.

Kalman can fail when a fixed seasonal cycle dominates, when known future
events drive the forecast, or when abrupt structural breaks are too large for
the process variance settings. A very reactive filter can chase noise; a very
stiff filter can miss real pickup-demand shifts. Use standardized innovations,
forecast intervals, and rolling-origin error to decide whether the variance
settings match the taxi series.

## Example

```python
from cartoboost.forecasting import KalmanForecaster

airport_pickups = [72, 75, 79, 82, 80, 86, 91, 96, 94, 99, 103, 108]

model = KalmanForecaster(
    level_process_variance=0.05,
    trend_process_variance=0.005,
    observation_variance=1.0,
)
model.fit(airport_pickups)
forecast = model.predict(6)

print(model.get_metadata())
print(forecast.predictions())
```

## Examples

Use these small examples to choose the right Kalman surface before moving to a
full taxi-zone panel.

| Example | Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A JFK pickup sensor is noisy but the true demand level is stable. | `cartoboost.local_level_kalman_filter` | One latent level is enough; there is no explicit slope. |
| Airport pickup demand is drifting upward through the evening rush. | `cartoboost.kalman_filter` | The local-linear model estimates both a level and a trend. |
| You need a normal forecast band for a dashboard. | `forecast_distribution` from either utility | It returns mean, variance, lower, and upper for each horizon. |
| You need to explain why a point looked unusual. | Per-step estimates and `diagnostics` | Innovations, standardized innovations, gains, and log likelihood show how surprising the observation was. |

Local-level example:

```python
import cartoboost as cb

zone_236_readings = [184.0, 187.0, 183.0, 186.0, 185.0, 188.0, 186.0]

state = cb.local_level_kalman_filter(
    zone_236_readings,
    level_process_variance=0.04,
    observation_variance=1.5,
    horizon=3,
)

print(state["final_state"])
print(state["forecast_distribution"])
```

Local-linear example:

```python
import cartoboost as cb

jfk_evening_pickups = [74.0, 76.0, 79.0, 78.0, 83.0, 86.0, 84.0, 90.0, 92.0]

state = cb.kalman_filter(
    jfk_evening_pickups,
    level_process_variance=0.08,
    trend_process_variance=0.01,
    observation_variance=2.0,
    horizon=4,
)

print(state["final_state"]["level"], state["final_state"]["trend"])
print(state["diagnostics"]["rmse"], state["diagnostics"]["mae"])
```

## ForecastFrame Example

```python
from cartoboost.forecasting import ForecastFrame, KalmanForecaster

frame = ForecastFrame.from_pandas(
    hourly_zone_demand.query("PULocationID == 132"),
    timestamp_col="pickup_hour",
    target_col="pickup_count",
    freq="h",
)

model = KalmanForecaster(
    level_process_variance=0.10,
    trend_process_variance=0.01,
    observation_variance=2.0,
)
model.fit(frame)
forecast = model.predict(12)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `level_process_variance` | Larger values let the level change faster. |
| `trend_process_variance` | Larger values let the trend change faster. |
| `observation_variance` | Larger values make the model trust noisy observations less. |

## Tuning Pattern

Start with the defaults, then evaluate a small grid:

```python
candidates = [
    {"level_process_variance": 0.02, "trend_process_variance": 0.002, "observation_variance": 1.0},
    {"level_process_variance": 0.05, "trend_process_variance": 0.005, "observation_variance": 1.0},
    {"level_process_variance": 0.10, "trend_process_variance": 0.010, "observation_variance": 2.0},
]
```

Select settings with rolling-origin validation, not in-sample fit.

## Validation Notes

Kalman models do not encode hour-of-day wraparound or zone geography. If those
effects matter, compare Kalman against seasonal naive and a lag model with
calendar features.

## Filtering Diagnostics

Use the plain utility when you need state diagnostics instead of only a
forecasting API result:

```python
import cartoboost as cb

state = cb.kalman_filter(
    airport_pickups,
    level_process_variance=0.05,
    trend_process_variance=0.005,
    observation_variance=1.0,
    horizon=6,
)

print(state["final_state"]["covariance"])
print(state["diagnostics"]["log_likelihood"])
print(state["smoothed_states"][-1])
print(state["forecast_distribution"][0])
```

`forecast_distribution` contains mean, variance, and normal-approximation bounds
for each future taxi pickup horizon. Per-step estimates include innovations,
standardized innovations, fitted values, residuals, innovation variance,
level/trend Kalman gains, covariance matrices, and Gaussian log likelihoods.
`smoothed_states` are fixed-interval backward-smoothed states over the observed
history, and `diagnostics` includes AIC, BIC, RMSE, MAE, and standardized
innovation summaries.

## Visual Diagnostics

The most useful Kalman plots show four things together:

- observed taxi counts,
- one-step fitted values,
- filtered and smoothed latent levels,
- forecast intervals for future horizons.

Run the committed example:

```bash
uv run python examples/forecasting/kalman_diagnostics_visualization.py
```

It writes `target/examples/kalman_diagnostics_visualization.png` and prints a
small JSON summary. The example uses synthetic JFK-style pickup counts and does
not download data.

The core plotting pattern is:

```python
from pathlib import Path

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cartoboost as cb

pickup_hours = list(range(18))
pickups = [
    74.0, 76.0, 79.0, 78.0, 83.0, 86.0,
    84.0, 90.0, 92.0, 91.0, 97.0, 101.0,
    99.0, 104.0, 108.0, 109.0, 114.0, 117.0,
]

state = cb.kalman_filter(
    pickups,
    level_process_variance=0.08,
    trend_process_variance=0.01,
    observation_variance=2.0,
    horizon=6,
)

estimate_hours = [row["step"] for row in state["estimates"]]
filtered = [row["level"] for row in state["estimates"]]
fitted = [row["fitted"] for row in state["estimates"]]
smoothed_hours = [row["step"] for row in state["smoothed_states"]]
smoothed = [row["level"] for row in state["smoothed_states"]]

future_hours = [pickup_hours[-1] + row["step"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
forecast_mean = [row["mean"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
forecast_lower = [row["lower"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
forecast_upper = [row["upper"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]

plt.plot(pickup_hours, pickups, marker="o", label="observed")
plt.plot(estimate_hours, fitted, linestyle="--", label="one-step fitted")
plt.plot(estimate_hours, filtered, label="filtered level")
plt.plot(smoothed_hours, smoothed, label="smoothed level")
plt.plot(future_hours, forecast_mean, marker="o", label="forecast")
plt.fill_between(future_hours, forecast_lower, forecast_upper, alpha=0.18, label="95% interval")
plt.xlabel("hour index")
plt.ylabel("pickup count")
plt.legend()

Path("target/examples").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
plt.savefig("target/examples/kalman_forecast_band.png", dpi=160)
```

Plot standardized innovations when you want to spot unusual observations:

```python
standardized = [row["standardized_innovation"] for row in state["estimates"]]

plt.figure()
plt.axhline(0.0, color="black", linewidth=1)
plt.axhline(1.96, color="gray", linestyle="--", linewidth=1)
plt.axhline(-1.96, color="gray", linestyle="--", linewidth=1)
plt.bar(estimate_hours, standardized)
plt.xlabel("hour index")
plt.ylabel("standardized innovation")
plt.savefig("target/examples/kalman_standardized_innovations.png", dpi=160)
```

Interpretation:

| Visual pattern | Meaning | Typical next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Filtered level chases every observation. | The model trusts observations too much. | Increase `observation_variance` or reduce process variances. |
| Smoothed level lags a real shift. | The latent state is too stiff. | Increase `level_process_variance`. |
| Forecast band is too narrow for recent errors. | Observation/process variance is too low. | Compare RMSE/MAE and raise variance settings. |
| Many standardized innovations cross +/-1.96. | Recent observations are surprising under the model. | Check missing calendar/zone effects or tune variances with backtesting. |

## Tuning With An Example Grid

For a real taxi workflow, score a small grid on a rolling split before choosing
parameters. Keep the split fixed across candidates.

```python
import cartoboost as cb

train = [74.0, 76.0, 79.0, 78.0, 83.0, 86.0, 84.0, 90.0, 92.0, 91.0, 97.0, 101.0]
validation = [99.0, 104.0, 108.0]

candidates = [
    {"level_process_variance": 0.03, "trend_process_variance": 0.003, "observation_variance": 1.0},
    {"level_process_variance": 0.08, "trend_process_variance": 0.010, "observation_variance": 2.0},
    {"level_process_variance": 0.15, "trend_process_variance": 0.020, "observation_variance": 3.0},
]

scores = []
for params in candidates:
    state = cb.kalman_filter(train, horizon=len(validation), **params)
    errors = [forecast - actual for forecast, actual in zip(state["forecast"], validation)]
    rmse = (sum(error * error for error in errors) / len(errors)) ** 0.5
    scores.append((rmse, params))

print(sorted(scores, key=lambda item: item[0])[0])
```

Use the diagnostic plots after picking the best validation candidate; do not
choose variance settings by making the in-sample line look smooth.
