# Parameters

This page summarizes the public training controls exposed by
`CartoBoostRegressor`, with emphasis on choosing controls that match the
scientific structure of temporal-spatial regression.

## Choose Parameters From The Question

Before tuning ranges, decide what claim the model needs to support. In NYC taxi
work, parameters should usually map to a modeling question:

| Scientific question | Controls to consider |
| --- | --- |
| Is a dense tabular baseline enough for fare, duration, demand, or residual prediction? | `splitters=None`, `["auto"]`, `["axis"]`, or `["axis_histogram:<bins>"]` |
| Are pickup/dropoff coordinates or projected x/y values defining spatial boundaries? | `diagonal_2d`, `gaussian_2d` |
| Does hour-of-day, weekday, or season wrap around? | `periodic:<period>` |
| Are rare zones, routes, cells, or service-area memberships part of the signal? | `sparse_set` plus `sparse_sets=` |
| Should nearby observations blend across an uncertain boundary? | `fuzzy=True`, `fuzzy_bandwidth`, `fuzzy_kernel` |
| Is the target about median-like behavior, outlier resistance, or asymmetric service risk? | `loss="mae"`, `loss="huber"`, `loss="log_l2"`, or `loss="quantile"` |
| Is a local trend still visible after the tree finds a region or time bucket? | `leaf_predictor="linear"`, `linear_leaf_features` |
| Does domain knowledge require monotone response to a dense feature? | `monotonic_constraints` |

Keep comparisons disciplined: change one family of modeling controls at a time
when possible, and compare against an axis-only CartoBoost baseline plus
LightGBM or XGBoost under the same split and feature set.

## Core Boosting

These parameters control model capacity and shrinkage. They are useful for
ordinary bias/variance tuning after the validation split is fixed.

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `n_estimators` | `100` | Number of boosting rounds. Must be non-negative. |
| `learning_rate` | `0.05` | Shrinks each tree contribution. Must be finite and positive. |
| `max_depth` | `4` | Maximum tree depth. `0` produces a constant model. |
| `min_samples_leaf` | `20` | Minimum weighted row count per leaf candidate. |
| `min_gain` | `1e-8` | Minimum gain required to split. |
| `random_state` | `None` | Reserved for deterministic APIs; current training paths are deterministic. |
| `n_threads` | `None` | Public parameter retained for compatibility; threaded training control is not currently exposed. |

## Loss

Choose the loss from the estimand. Mean regression is appropriate for many
fare or duration targets, but taxi data often contains heavy tails, dispatch
exceptions, airport trips, and localized service-level questions.

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `loss` | `"l2"` | Accepts `"l2"`, `"squared_error"`, `"l1"`, `"mae"`, `"absolute_error"`, `"huber"`, `"log_l2"`, `"quantile"`, or `"pinball"`. |
| `quantile_alpha` | `0.5` | Required to be finite and in `(0, 1)` for quantile loss. |
| `huber_delta` | `1.0` | Positive clipping threshold for Huber loss. |
| `log_offset` | `1.0` | Positive offset for `log_l2`; the current backend supports `1.0`. |

`l1`, `huber`, `log_l2`, and quantile loss currently require
`leaf_predictor="constant"`.

## Splitters

The splitter list is the main CartoBoost modeling choice. By default,
`splitters=None` uses `auto`: exact `axis` on small or constrained fits, and a
fast histogram-axis search for larger dense L2 fits. Use `axis` explicitly when
you need exact threshold search, then add the splitters that match the
scientific structure in the rows.

| Name | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `auto` | Default policy that chooses exact axis or histogram-axis training from the fit shape and objective. |
| `axis` | Standard one-feature threshold splits. |
| `axis_histogram`, `axis_hist`, `histogram`, `axis_histogram:<bins>` | Fast axis-threshold search for dense numeric features. |
| `diagonal_2d`, `diagonal2d` | Oblique 2D boundaries for coordinates or projected x/y features. |
| `gaussian_2d`, `gaussian2d`, `radial` | Radial neighborhoods around local hotspots, depots, zones, or corridors. |
| `periodic_time`, `periodic_24`, `periodic:<period>` | Wraparound time features such as hour-of-day, weekday, or seasonal phase. |
| `sparse_set`, `sparse` | List-valued taxi-zone, zone, grid, or encoded H3 memberships. |

Unknown splitter names raise `ValueError`.

Common temporal-spatial combinations:

| Problem shape | Suggested splitters |
| --- | --- |
| General tabular baseline | `None` or `["auto"]` |
| Exact axis baseline | `["axis"]` |
| Dense location and time | `["axis", "diagonal_2d", "gaussian_2d", "periodic:24"]` |
| Route or cell membership | `["axis", "periodic:24", "sparse_set"]` |
| Location plus taxi zones | `["axis", "diagonal_2d", "gaussian_2d", "periodic:24", "sparse_set"]` |

## Leaves

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `leaf_predictor` | `"constant"` | Accepts `"constant"` or `"linear"`. |
| `linear_leaf_features` | `None` | Python API currently expects stringified integer feature indices, such as `["0", "2"]`. |
| `l2_regularization` | `1.0` | Ridge penalty for linear leaves. |

Use linear leaves when the tree can find a region, taxi zone, or time bucket
but the remaining residual trend inside that region is still approximately
linear. For example, a learned airport corridor may still have a distance or
time-of-day trend represented locally rather than globally.

## Fuzzy Routing

| Parameter | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fuzzy` | `False` | Enables fractional branch assignment during training and weighted prediction recursion. |
| `fuzzy_bandwidth` | `0.0` | Split transition bandwidth. Must be finite and non-negative. |
| `fuzzy_kernel` | `"linear"` | Transition shape. Accepts `"linear"`, `"gaussian"`, `"exponential"`, `"bisquare"`, `"epanechnikov"`, or `"tricube"`. |

Fuzzy routing is not compatible with monotonic constraints.

Use fuzzy routing for temporal-spatial features where nearby values should not
change abruptly at a learned boundary. This is especially relevant when zone
edges, corridor definitions, pickup coordinates, or service areas are noisy
measurements of a continuous process. Set `fuzzy_bandwidth` in the same units
as the feature values, such as projected coordinate units or hours. Use
`fuzzy_kernel="linear"` for simple piecewise interpolation, `"gaussian"` or
`"tricube"` for smoother transitions, and compact-support kernels like
`"bisquare"` or `"epanechnikov"` when you want the blend to drop off faster
near the edge of the band.

## Monotonic Constraints

`monotonic_constraints` is a list of `-1`, `0`, or `1` values with one entry per
dense feature:

- `1` requires predictions to be non-decreasing in that feature.
- `-1` requires predictions to be non-increasing in that feature.
- `0` leaves the feature unconstrained.

Current constraints require constant leaves, non-fuzzy training, and axis-style
splitters. Use them when the scientific design requires directional behavior,
such as non-decreasing fare with distance after accounting for the rest of the
feature set, and document that constraint in the model artifact or report.
