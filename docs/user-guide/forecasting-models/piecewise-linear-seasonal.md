# Piecewise Linear Seasonal

`PiecewiseLinearSeasonalForecaster` is the Rust-native local model for
interpretable trend, changepoints, seasonalities, events, extra regressors, and
component decomposition. It gives CartoBoost a Prophet-style modeling surface
without making Stan, CmdStan, or Python fitting code part of the forecasting
contract.

## When To Use

Use this model for one regular taxi demand, fare, duration, or trip-distance
series when the forecast should be explained as:

- a piecewise trend with optional changepoints;
- one or more repeating seasonal components;
- known event windows or known future regressors;
- additive or multiplicative component effects;
- external trend belief adjustments for forecast horizons;
- recent residual shock propagation when the fitted trend has under- or
  over-predicted for several consecutive observations;
- residual intervals or quantile-style uncertainty summaries.

It is a good fit for airport pickup demand with event windows, Midtown demand
with recurring weekday and hour effects, or lane-level aggregate demand where a
scientist needs to inspect the trend and seasonal contribution separately.

Prefer seasonal naive, theta, ETS, ARIMA, or Kalman when the question is only a
small local baseline. Prefer `CartoBoostLagForecaster` or `AutoForecaster` when
many related zones or lanes should share supervised lag features.

## Scientific Role

Piecewise linear seasonal forecasting is a component model. It asks whether the
future can be explained by a trend path plus named seasonal, event, and
regressor effects. That makes it useful when the model output must support a
claim such as "the weekday seasonality explains the recurring lift, while the
trend changed after this cutoff."

The component rows are part of the evidence. If a benchmark or report uses this
model, preserve the forecast table, component decomposition, changepoints,
input cadence, regressors, and validation split with the metrics.

## Assumptions And Failure Modes

The model assumes the configured seasonal periods and event/regressor columns
match the forecast cadence and are known at prediction time. It can fail when
the strongest signal is cross-zone borrowing, sparse intermittent demand,
unmodeled disruptions, or a supervised panel effect that a local component model
cannot see.

Common failure modes in taxi data:

| Failure mode | Scientific interpretation | Comparison to run |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trend changes too often. | Changepoint flexibility is fitting noise. | ETS, Kalman, or fewer changepoints. |
| Seasonal component is phase-shifted. | Season length or timestamp cadence is wrong. | Seasonal naive on the same cadence. |
| Event effect persists outside its window. | The event window is standing in for missing covariates. | Lag model with explicit calendar features. |
| One lane fits and another fails. | Local components do not transfer across panels. | CartoBoost lag or AutoForecaster. |

## Example

```python
from cartoboost.forecasting import ForecastFrame, PiecewiseLinearSeasonalForecaster

frame = ForecastFrame.from_pandas(
    hourly_airport_pickups,
    timestamp_col="pickup_hour",
    target_col="pickup_trips",
    series_id_col="PULocationID",
    freq="h",
    known_future_covariates=["hour", "day_of_week", "holiday_event"],
)

model = PiecewiseLinearSeasonalForecaster(
    growth="linear",
    changepoints=8,
    weekly_fourier_order=3,
    daily_fourier_order=4,
    prediction_interval_levels=(0.8, 0.95),
)

forecast = model.fit(frame).predict(24)
components = model.components(24)
history_components = model.history_components()
history_frame = model.history_components_frame()
```

Prophet-shaped holiday and changepoint inputs are accepted as configuration
ergonomics over the same Rust-native model. The default automatic changepoint
count is 25, matching Prophet's public default. CartoBoost's default
`changepoint_range` is 1.0 so lane-level nowcasts can place trend breaks across
the full training window when recent demand is moving; set
`changepoint_range=0.8` when you need Prophet's stricter default placement.
Use `n_changepoints` for automatic changepoint placement, pass explicit dates
through `changepoints=[...]` or `changepoint_timestamps=[...]`, and pass a
Prophet-style `holidays` table with `holiday`, `ds`, optional `lower_window`,
`upper_window`, and `prior_scale` columns. Holidays are normalized into native
event windows, and prior scales are translated into per-event L2 penalties
before fitting. Prophet-style
`changepoint_prior_scale`, `seasonality_prior_scale`, `seasonality_mode`, and
`holidays_mode` aliases map to the native changepoint penalty, seasonality
penalty, component mode, and event mode fields.
The WebAssembly forecast API accepts the same modeling aliases in camelCase:
`nChangepoints`, `changepointPriorScale`, `seasonalityPriorScale`,
`holidaysPriorScale`, `seasonalityMode`, `holidaysMode`, `intervalWidth`, and
Prophet-shaped `holidays` rows with `holiday`, `ds`, `lowerWindow`,
`upperWindow`, and `priorScale`.

Built-in country holiday calendars are available before fitting through
`model.add_country_holidays("US")` or the constructor argument
`country_holidays="US"`. This path requires the optional `holidays` package:
install `cartoboost[holidays]` when country calendars are needed. Explicit
`holidays` dataframes do not require that extra.

The Python class validates configuration and delegates fitting, prediction,
component extraction, fitted artifact serialization, and forecast rows to the
native binding. Python should not reimplement component math or fallback
prediction behavior.

## Prophet-Style Plotting

The local plotting layer provides full public plotting-utility parity with the
`prophet.plot` module from `prophet==1.2.2`, the package version resolved by
CartoBoost's benchmark dependency range `prophet>=1.1,<1.3`. Use
`cartoboost.plotting.plot`, `plot_components`, `plot_forecast_component`,
`plot_weekly`, `plot_yearly`, `plot_seasonality`,
`add_changepoints_to_plot`, `plot_cross_validation_metric`, the matching
Plotly helpers, and the helper-prop functions when a report expects Prophet's
plotting API names.

The proof is maintained in [Plotting](../../plotting.md): it lists every public
`prophet.plot` 1.2.2 utility beside the matching local implementation and
points to the parity tests in `tests/python/test_plotting.py`. This parity is
limited to plotting utilities over Prophet-shaped forecast/component data; the
reusable model API remains `PiecewiseLinearSeasonalForecaster`, not a
`prophet` alias.

## Trend Beliefs And Residual Shocks

Use `trend_adjustments` when forecast-time market beliefs should move the local
trend path without changing the fitted historical coefficients. The mapping is
keyed by forecast horizon, with values interpreted as trend multipliers. For
example, `{1: 1.01, 2: 1.02}` raises the horizon-1 trend by 1 percent and the
horizon-2 trend by 2 percent before the final forecast is assembled. Panel
models can use `trend_adjustments_by_series` for route- or zone-specific
beliefs; per-series values override global horizon values.

```python
model = PiecewiseLinearSeasonalForecaster(
    changepoints=8,
    weekly_fourier_order=3,
    trend_adjustments={1: 1.01, 2: 1.02, 3: 1.03},
    trend_adjustments_by_series={
        "132": {1: 1.04, 2: 1.05},
    },
)
```

Use residual shocks when recent same-sign residuals indicate that the local
trend is persistently under- or over-predicting a market. Set
`residual_shock_window` to the required run length, `residual_shock_scale` to
the fraction of the recent average residual to pass through, and
`residual_shock_decay` to control how quickly the shock fades across horizons.
The default scale is zero, so shock propagation is opt-in.

```python
model = PiecewiseLinearSeasonalForecaster(
    changepoints=8,
    weekly_fourier_order=3,
    residual_shock_window=3,
    residual_shock_scale=0.5,
    residual_shock_decay=0.8,
)
```

Component records include `trend`, `adjusted_trend`,
`trend_adjustment_multiplier`, `trend_adjustment`, and `residual_shock` so a
taxi demand report can separate fitted trend, external market belief, and
recent residual carry-forward.

## Historical Component Diagnostics

Use `history_components()` after fitting when rolling-origin backtests need to
explain why a cutoff won or lost. Use `history_components_frame()` when the
same Rust-computed records should be flattened into plottable pandas columns
such as `components.seasonal_total`, `components.weekly`, or
`components.events.airport_surge`. The methods return one row for every
training observation and are computed from the fitted coefficients and the
original covariates. Each row includes:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `actual` | Observed target for the training timestamp. |
| `fitted` | In-sample fitted value from the same component equation used for prediction. |
| `residual` | `actual - fitted`, useful for diagnosing systematic under- or over-fit before a holdout. |
| `trend` | Fitted trend path before forecast-time external trend adjustments. |
| `trend_movement` | Change in fitted trend versus the previous training row for that series. |
| `fitted_movement` | Change in fitted total value versus the previous training row for that series. |
| `components` | Named component contributions, including `seasonal_total`, `yearly`, `weekly`, `daily`, custom seasonalities, event totals, and regressor totals. |

`history_components_frame()` keeps the top-level fields and expands nested
components with dotted column names:

| Column | Diagnostic use |
| --- | --- |
| `trend` | Plot the fitted level/trend path against `actual` to see whether the model is tracking the lane's current demand level. |
| `trend_movement` | Compare week-over-week trend movement with the last observed week-over-week target movement. Near-zero movement during a rising lane usually means the trend is too stiff. |
| `components.seasonal_total` | Check whether seasonality is doing most of the work or offsetting trend in the wrong direction. |
| `components.yearly`, `components.weekly`, `components.daily` | Inspect built-in Fourier seasonal effects separately when the aggregate seasonal total looks plausible but one cadence is wrong. |
| `components.events.*` | Verify that holiday or event windows explain known calendar shocks instead of forcing the trend to absorb them. |
| `components.regressors.*` | Verify known future or historical regressor contribution and sign. |
| `residual` | Identify whether the model is already biased immediately before the holdout. |

For a weekly lane backtest with 12 cutoffs, run the model once per cutoff,
holding out one additional week each time, then persist both the holdout
predictions and `history_components_frame()` from that cutoff fit. When Prophet
beats CartoBoost with a negative bias, inspect the last several historical
component rows before each cutoff:

```python
diagnostics_by_cutoff = {}

for cutoff, train in weekly_cutoff_training_frames:
    model = PiecewiseLinearSeasonalForecaster(
        n_changepoints=25,
        weekly_fourier_order=3,
        changepoint_range=1.0,
    ).fit(train)
    diagnostics_by_cutoff[str(cutoff)] = {
        "history_components": model.history_components_frame(),
        "forecast_components": model.components(1)["records"],
        "forecast": model.predict(1).to_pandas(),
    }
```

To recreate a trend/seasonality comparison table, concatenate the stored
history frames with the cutoff label:

```python
import pandas as pd

history = pd.concat(
    frame.assign(cutoff=cutoff)
    for cutoff, frame in diagnostics_by_cutoff.items()
)

trend_columns = [
    "cutoff",
    "series_id",
    "timestamp",
    "actual",
    "fitted",
    "residual",
    "trend",
    "trend_movement",
    "components.seasonal_total",
]

trend_table = history[trend_columns].sort_values(
    ["cutoff", "series_id", "timestamp"]
)
```

If `trend_movement` is near zero while the last observed weeks are rising, the
trend is too stiff for the lane. If `seasonal_total` is large and offsetting the
trend in the wrong direction, inspect the cadence and Fourier order. If recent
residuals are consistently positive before the cutoff, the model is
under-predicting the lane before it ever reaches the holdout; consider fewer or
better placed changepoints, explicit event/regressor inputs, or an opt-in
residual shock rather than treating the holdout error as a pure forecast-horizon
problem.

CartoBoost defaults to `n_changepoints=25` and `changepoint_range=1.0`. This
keeps the automatic changepoint count aligned with Prophet's public default but
allows late trend breaks across the full training window, which matters for
one-week-ahead lane nowcasts where the most recent movement carries the holdout.
Use `changepoint_range=0.8` only when you intentionally want Prophet's stricter
placement window for an apples-to-apples tuning probe.

The browser Modeling Lab uses the same WASM modeling aliases for
`piecewise_linear_seasonal` fits and requests the same `components` and
`historyComponents` payloads. Its Prophet-style debugger flattens every numeric
component key emitted by Rust, so built-in seasonalities, custom seasonalities,
event windows, regressors, aggregate non-trend totals, fitted movement, trend
movement, and residuals are available without a separate Python plotting step.
