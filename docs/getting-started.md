# Getting Started

This guide starts with the modeling decisions that matter for CartoBoost:
target, place/time structure, validation, and baselines. The code snippets show
the mechanics after those choices are clear.

## 1. Frame The Scientific Question

CartoBoost is meant for regression and forecasting tasks where temporal or
spatial structure is part of the hypothesis. In the NYC taxi domain, typical
questions include:

- Can pickup hour, weekday, pickup zone, dropoff zone, and trip distance explain
  transformed trip duration under a leakage-aware split?
- Does route direction, such as `PULocationID -> DOLocationID`, change fare or
  duration estimates compared with treating the two zones as unordered IDs?
- Can daily pickup-zone or pickup/dropoff-lane demand be forecast from lagged
  demand, calendar features, airport-lane indicators, and borough context?
- Do spatial splitters or sparse zone memberships recover signal that an
  axis-only model misses?

Define the target and evaluation split before selecting model features. For
temporal-spatial data, random splits can overstate quality when near-duplicate
times, zones, or route patterns appear in both train and validation data.

## 2. Choose Features For Place And Time

A first taxi regression table might include:

- dense numeric columns: trip distance, pickup longitude/latitude, dropoff
  longitude/latitude, pickup hour, weekday, passenger count;
- periodic columns: hour-of-day with period `24`, day-of-week with period `7`;
- sparse-set columns: taxi zones, route cells, or memberships derived from
  `PULocationID` and `DOLocationID`;
- graph context: directed pickup-to-dropoff flows when source and target roles
  should remain distinct.

Match splitters to the scientific structure you want to test:

- use `axis` as the dense baseline splitter;
- add `periodic:24` for hour-of-day effects;
- add `diagonal_2d` or `gaussian_2d` when coordinates or projected zone
  centroids are central to the question;
- add `sparse_set` when rows carry list-valued zone or route memberships.

## 3. Install

```sh
uv add cartoboost
```

Verify the install:

```sh
python -c "import cartoboost; print(cartoboost.__version__)"
cartoboost --help
```

Optional packages are installed only when needed. For example, use
`cartoboost[polars]` for Polars inputs, `cartoboost[optuna]` for Optuna tuning,
or `cartoboost[onnx]` for the supported ONNX export subset.

## 4. Fit A Taxi-Style Regression Model

The snippet below assumes you have already built `X_train`, `X_validation`,
`y_train`, and `y_validation` from a leakage-aware split, such as holding out
the latest pickup dates.

```python
from cartoboost import CartoBoostRegressor

model = CartoBoostRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,
    learning_rate=0.04,
    max_depth=5,
    min_samples_leaf=30,
    splitters=["axis", "periodic:24", "diagonal_2d", "gaussian_2d"],
)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_validation)
```

Start with a smaller splitter set if the study only needs dense numeric
features. Add spatial, periodic, sparse, neural, or graph structure only when it
matches the modeling question and passes the same validation split.

## 5. Use Sparse Taxi-Zone Memberships

Use sparse-set features when a trip belongs to multiple route or zone-derived
sets and a wide one-hot matrix would be awkward or unstable.

```python
schema = {
    "dense": [
        {"name": "trip_distance", "kind": "numeric"},
        {"name": "pickup_hour", "kind": "periodic", "period": 24},
        {"name": "pickup_x", "kind": "numeric"},
        {"name": "pickup_y", "kind": "numeric"},
    ],
    "sparse_sets": [
        {"name": "taxi_zones", "kind": "sparse_set"},
    ],
}

model = CartoBoostRegressor(
    n_estimators=200,
    learning_rate=0.04,
    max_depth=5,
    min_samples_leaf=30,
    splitters=["axis", "periodic:24", "sparse_set"],
)

model.fit(
    X_train_dense,
    y_train,
    sparse_sets={"taxi_zones": taxi_zones_train},
    feature_schema=schema,
)
```

See [Spatial Modeling](spatial_modeling.md) and
[Sparse Features](sparse_features.md) for zone membership examples and blocked
evaluation patterns.

## 6. Forecast Taxi Demand

Use `ForecastFrame` when the target is future demand, fare, duration, or another
time-indexed quantity. Panel data should identify the series, such as
pickup/dropoff lane or pickup zone.

```python
import pandas as pd

from cartoboost.forecasting import ForecastFrame, ThetaForecaster

daily_lanes = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "lane_id": ["JFK->LGA"] * 10 + ["LGA->EWR"] * 10,
        "date": list(pd.date_range("2026-01-01", periods=10, freq="D")) * 2,
        "pickup_trips": [
            20, 21, 24, 23, 25, 28, 29, 27, 30, 31,
            35, 36, 38, 37, 40, 42, 43, 41, 45, 46,
        ],
    }
)

frame = ForecastFrame.from_pandas(
    daily_lanes,
    timestamp_col="date",
    target_col="pickup_trips",
    series_id_col="lane_id",
    freq="D",
)

model = ThetaForecaster(season_length=7, prediction_interval_levels=[0.8, 0.95])
model.fit(frame)
forecast = model.predict(horizon=3).to_pandas()
```

Forecast tables are deterministic: `series_id`, `timestamp`, `horizon`,
`model`, `mean`, and interval columns such as `lower_80` and `upper_80`.
Use [Forecasting](forecasting.md) for rolling-origin backtesting, CartoBoost lag
features, artifact persistence, CLI workflows, and model selection.

## 7. Validate Against Real Baselines

For temporal-spatial problems, hold out the latest rows before trusting model
quality:

```python
from cartoboost import out_of_time_split

train_idx, validation_idx = out_of_time_split(
    pickup_times,
    validation_fraction=0.2,
)

model.fit(X_all[train_idx], y_all[train_idx])
predictions = model.predict(X_all[validation_idx])
```

Report the split design, target transform, feature set, RMSE, MAE, R2, training
time, prediction time, and model settings. Compare against serious baselines on
the same train/validation rows, such as LightGBM or XGBoost for tabular
regression and appropriate local or external forecasting models for demand
forecasting.

See [Evaluation Protocol](evaluation_protocol.md) for out-of-time,
spatial-blocked, grouped, and leakage-aware validation.

## 8. Add Neural Or Graph Structure When Justified

Use learned embeddings when high-cardinality IDs carry stable signal that is not
captured by dense features alone.

```python
from cartoboost import NeuralEmbeddingRegressor

neural_model = NeuralEmbeddingRegressor(
    dim=16,
    base_model_kwargs={"n_estimators": 80, "splitters": ["axis"]},
    final_model_kwargs={
        "n_estimators": 120,
        "splitters": ["axis", "periodic:24"],
    },
)

neural_model.fit(X_train, y_train, ids=pickup_zone_ids_train)
predictions = neural_model.predict(X_validation, ids=pickup_zone_ids_validation)
```

Use graph features or standalone graph models when the observed units are
connected entities, such as directed pickup/dropoff lanes, borough-zone
hierarchies, or repeated OD-pair flow patterns. See
[Graph Models And Features](graph-features.md) and
[Neural Embedding Models And Features](neural-features.md).

## 9. Save Reproducible Artifacts

```python
model.save("taxi-duration.cartoboost.json")
loaded = CartoBoostRegressor.load("taxi-duration.cartoboost.json")

model.save_weights("taxi-duration.weights.json")
weights_loaded = CartoBoostRegressor.load_weights("taxi-duration.weights.json")
```

Use `save` for CartoBoost JSON model artifacts and `save_weights` for portable
prediction artifacts. ONNX export is available only for dense axis-tree
constant-leaf models when the optional `onnx` dependency is installed.

## 10. Source Checkout Checks

For a source checkout, run the full local validation suite with:

```sh
just validate
```

For a faster Python-focused loop:

```sh
uv run --group dev pre-commit run --all-files
uv run --group dev pytest
```
