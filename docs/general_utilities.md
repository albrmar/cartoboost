# General Utilities

CartoBoost includes Rust-backed numerical utilities that can be used without
building a `CartoBoostRegressor` or a forecasting `ForecastFrame`. Use these
when you have a plain Python sequence, a small spatial interpolation problem, or
an intermittent-demand sequence and want a direct result.

These functions are useful for scientific checks and ablations: they let you
compare a full estimator or forecasting wrapper against the same Rust-native
building block on a simple taxi-zone sequence, route panel, or coordinate
interpolation problem.

```python
import cartoboost as cb
```

## Local-Level Kalman

Use local-level Kalman filtering when the signal is a noisy measurement of a
slowly moving level and there is no explicit trend term.

Example: a pickup-zone counter reads a stable hourly demand level with small
noise, and you want a smoothed level plus a short flat forecast.

```python
import cartoboost as cb

readings = [99.0, 101.0, 100.0, 102.0, 101.0, 103.0]

state = cb.local_level_kalman_filter(
    readings,
    level_process_variance=0.05,
    observation_variance=1.0,
    horizon=3,
)

print(state["final_state"]["level"])
print(state["forecast"])
```

For just the forecast means:

```python
forecast = cb.local_level_kalman_forecast(
    readings,
    horizon=3,
    level_process_variance=0.05,
    observation_variance=1.0,
)
```

Parameters:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `level_process_variance` | How much the latent level is allowed to move between observations. Larger values adapt faster. |
| `observation_variance` | Measurement noise. Larger values smooth the observations more strongly. |
| `horizon` | Number of future means to emit from the filtered final state. |

Return shape:

- `local_level_kalman_filter(...)` returns a dictionary with per-step estimates,
  final level state, fixed-interval `smoothed_states`, optional `forecast`,
  optional `forecast_distribution`, and `diagnostics`.
- Each estimate includes the prior level, filtered level, variances, innovation,
  fitted value, residual, standardized innovation, Kalman gain, and per-step
  Gaussian log likelihood.
- `forecast_distribution` rows include `step`, `mean`, observation `variance`,
  and normal-approximation `lower`/`upper` bounds. Use `interval_z` to control
  the interval width.
- `diagnostics` includes log likelihood, AIC, BIC, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
  standardized-innovation summaries.
- `local_level_kalman_forecast(...)` returns `list[float]`.

Visualization example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cartoboost as cb

readings = [184.0, 187.0, 183.0, 186.0, 185.0, 188.0, 186.0]
state = cb.local_level_kalman_filter(readings, horizon=3)

steps = list(range(len(readings)))
smoothed_steps = [row["step"] for row in state["smoothed_states"]]
smoothed = [row["level"] for row in state["smoothed_states"]]
future_steps = [steps[-1] + row["step"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
future_mean = [row["mean"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
future_lower = [row["lower"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
future_upper = [row["upper"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]

plt.plot(steps, readings, marker="o", label="observed zone pickups")
plt.plot(smoothed_steps, smoothed, label="smoothed level")
plt.plot(future_steps, future_mean, marker="o", label="forecast")
plt.fill_between(future_steps, future_lower, future_upper, alpha=0.18)
plt.legend()
plt.savefig("target/examples/local_level_kalman_utility.png", dpi=160)
```

## Local-Linear-Trend Kalman

Use local-linear Kalman filtering when the series has a level and a slope. This
matches load, traffic, or pickup counts that drift over time.

Example: daily pickup demand is increasing by about two trips per day, with
noise.

```python
import cartoboost as cb

pickups = [40.0, 42.0, 45.0, 47.0, 50.0, 51.0, 54.0]

state = cb.kalman_filter(
    pickups,
    level_process_variance=0.05,
    trend_process_variance=0.005,
    observation_variance=0.5,
    horizon=4,
)

print(state["final_state"]["level"], state["final_state"]["trend"])
print(state["forecast"])
```

For just the forecast means:

```python
forecast = cb.local_linear_trend_kalman_forecast(
    pickups,
    horizon=4,
    level_process_variance=0.05,
    trend_process_variance=0.005,
    observation_variance=0.5,
)
```

Parameters:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `level_process_variance` | Process noise for the latent level. |
| `trend_process_variance` | Process noise for the latent trend/slope. |
| `observation_variance` | Measurement noise in the observed values. |
| `horizon` | Number of future means to emit from the final level/trend state. |
| `interval_z` | Normal critical value used for `forecast_distribution` bounds when `horizon > 0`. |

Return shape:

- `kalman_filter(...)` returns final level/trend state, final covariance,
  fixed-interval `smoothed_states`, per-step estimates, optional point
  `forecast`, optional `forecast_distribution`, and `diagnostics`.
- Each local-linear estimate includes prior and filtered state values,
  covariance matrices, fitted value, residual, standardized innovation,
  innovation variance, level/trend gains, and per-step Gaussian log likelihood.
- `diagnostics` includes log likelihood, AIC, BIC, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
  standardized-innovation summaries.

Visualization example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cartoboost as cb

pickups = [40.0, 42.0, 45.0, 47.0, 50.0, 51.0, 54.0]
state = cb.kalman_filter(pickups, horizon=4)

steps = list(range(len(pickups)))
estimate_steps = [row["step"] for row in state["estimates"]]
filtered = [row["level"] for row in state["estimates"]]
fitted = [row["fitted"] for row in state["estimates"]]
future_steps = [steps[-1] + row["step"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
future_mean = [row["mean"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
future_lower = [row["lower"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]
future_upper = [row["upper"] for row in state["forecast_distribution"]]

plt.plot(steps, pickups, marker="o", label="observed pickup count")
plt.plot(estimate_steps, fitted, linestyle="--", label="one-step fitted")
plt.plot(estimate_steps, filtered, label="filtered level")
plt.plot(future_steps, future_mean, marker="o", label="forecast")
plt.fill_between(future_steps, future_lower, future_upper, alpha=0.18)
plt.legend()
plt.savefig("target/examples/local_linear_kalman_utility.png", dpi=160)
```

Forecasting wrapper:

Use `KalmanForecaster` when you want the same local-linear model behind the
forecasting API.

```python
from cartoboost.forecasting.local import KalmanForecaster

model = KalmanForecaster(
    level_process_variance=0.05,
    trend_process_variance=0.005,
    observation_variance=0.5,
)
model.fit([40.0, 42.0, 45.0, 47.0, 50.0, 51.0, 54.0])
result = model.predict(4)

print(result.predictions())
```

Panel input is also supported:

```python
model.fit(
    {
        "PULocationID_142": [40.0, 42.0, 45.0, 47.0],
        "PULocationID_236": [70.0, 69.0, 68.0, 66.0],
    }
)
```

## Ordinary Kriging

Use ordinary kriging when you have observed values at known coordinates and want
spatial interpolation at new coordinates. The utility is independent of
forecasting. The forecasting wrapper uses the latest observed value for each
series and interpolates across panel coordinates.

Example: three taxi zones have observed pickup pressure, and you want the
estimated pressure at a nearby zone centroid.

```python
import cartoboost as cb

observations = [
    (0.0, 0.0, 10.0),  # x, y, value
    (1.0, 0.0, 20.0),
    (0.0, 1.0, 14.0),
]
targets = [
    (0.25, 0.25),
    (0.75, 0.10),
]

predictions = cb.ordinary_kriging_predict(
    observations,
    targets,
    range=1.5,
    nugget=1.0e-6,
    variogram_model="spherical",
    detailed=True,
)

for row in predictions:
    print(row["x"], row["y"], row["mean"], row["variance"], row["neighbor_indices"])
```

Parameters:

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `observations` | Sequence of `(x, y, value)` triples. |
| `targets` | Sequence of `(x, y)` coordinates to interpolate. |
| `range` | Distance scale for spatial covariance. Larger values spread influence farther. |
| `nugget` | Small diagonal variance for numerical stability and measurement noise. |
| `sill` | Marginal spatial covariance scale. |
| `variogram_model` | `exponential`, `gaussian`, `spherical`, or `linear`. |
| `drift` | `ordinary` for constant mean or `linear` for universal kriging with x/y drift. |
| `anisotropy_angle_degrees`, `anisotropy_scaling` | Rotate and stretch the spatial distance metric. |
| `max_neighbors`, `min_neighbors`, `max_distance` | Optional target-local neighbor selection. All-neighbor predictions cache the kriging system once for faster many-target scoring. |
| `detailed` | When true, include kriging variance and selected neighbor indices. |

Return shape:

- `ordinary_kriging_predict(...)` returns a list of dictionaries:
  `{"x": ..., "y": ..., "mean": ..., "weights": [...]}`.
- With `detailed=True`, each row also includes `variance` and
  `neighbor_indices`.
- `ordinary_kriging_leave_one_out(...)` returns the detailed row shape for each
  held-out observation and is intended for spatial residual diagnostics.
- `empirical_variogram(...)` returns binned semivariances with lag boundaries,
  mean lag distance, and pair counts.
- `fit_ordinary_kriging_variogram(...)` runs Rust weighted least-squares
  selection over variogram, range, nugget, and sill candidates and returns the
  selected config plus the empirical bins and objective value.
- `ordinary_kriging_leave_one_out_diagnostics(...)` returns held-out predictions
  plus residual metrics such as bias, MAE, RMSE, standardized RMSE, 95% interval
  coverage, and average kriging variance.

Forecasting wrapper:

Use `KrigingForecaster` when the data is a panel of series and each series has
a fixed coordinate. The wrapper forecasts each series by kriging the latest
known panel values at that series coordinate.

```python
from cartoboost.forecasting.local import KrigingForecaster

coordinates = {
    "PULocationID_142": (0.0, 0.0),
    "PULocationID_236": (1.0, 0.0),
    "PULocationID_239": (0.0, 1.0),
}

model = KrigingForecaster(coordinates=coordinates, range=1.5, nugget=1.0e-6)
model.fit(
    {
        "PULocationID_142": [10.0, 12.0],
        "PULocationID_236": [20.0, 21.0],
        "PULocationID_239": [14.0, 15.0],
    }
)
result = model.predict(1)

print(result.predictions())
```

Coordinates can also be passed as triples:

```python
KrigingForecaster(
    coordinates=[
        ("PULocationID_142", 0.0, 0.0),
        ("PULocationID_236", 1.0, 0.0),
    ],
)
```

## Intermittent Demand

Use Croston-family utilities when demand is non-negative and contains many
zeros. They are useful for sparse pickup requests, low-volume parts, or rare
lane/customer activity.

Example: a low-volume lane has several zero-demand days and occasional
orders.

```python
import cartoboost as cb

demand = [0.0, 0.0, 4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 5.0, 0.0]

croston = cb.croston_forecast(demand, horizon=5, alpha=0.2)
sba = cb.sba_forecast(demand, horizon=5, alpha=0.2)
tsb = cb.tsb_forecast(demand, horizon=5, alpha=0.2, beta=0.1)

print(croston)
print(sba)
print(tsb)
```

Method guide:

| Method | Entry point | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Croston | `croston_forecast` or `intermittent_demand_forecast(method="croston")` | You need a simple baseline for sparse non-zero events. |
| SBA | `sba_forecast` or `intermittent_demand_forecast(method="sba")` | You want Croston with a standard bias adjustment. |
| TSB | `tsb_forecast` or `intermittent_demand_forecast(method="tsb")` | You want separate smoothing for event probability and non-zero demand size. |

Inputs must be finite and non-negative. The output is a `list[float]` of length
`horizon`.

## Single-Series Forecast Utilities

The same Rust-native local models used by forecasting wrappers can be called on
plain numeric sequences:

```python
import cartoboost as cb

values = [20.0, 21.0, 19.0, 22.0, 23.0, 24.0, 26.0]

print(cb.naive_forecast(values, horizon=3))
print(cb.seasonal_naive_forecast(values, horizon=3, season_length=7))
print(cb.theta_forecast(values, horizon=3))
print(cb.optimized_theta_forecast(values, horizon=3))
print(cb.ets_forecast(values, horizon=3, alpha=0.5, beta=0.1))
print(cb.arima_forecast(values, horizon=3, p=1, d=1, q=0))
print(cb.auto_arima_forecast(values, horizon=3, max_p=2, max_d=1, max_q=1))
```

Use `series_forecast` when the model name is dynamic:

```python
forecast = cb.series_forecast(
    "local_linear_trend_kalman",
    values,
    horizon=3,
    level_process_variance=0.05,
    trend_process_variance=0.005,
    observation_variance=1.0,
)
```

| Noisy level plus slope | `kalman_filter` or `local_linear_trend_kalman_forecast` |
| Spatial interpolation from coordinate samples | `ordinary_kriging_predict` |
| Sparse non-negative demand | `sba_forecast` or `tsb_forecast` |
